        <p> At some point, we've all woken up from a deep sleep to discover a numb hand. Occasional numbness or pins and needles is normal. It usually occurs when you snooze in a strange position that cuts off circulation and causes your hand to "fall asleep."But if you tend to feel tingling or numbness in your hand or fingers more frequently upon waking, you may be dealing with a larger issue.

          We spoke to two neurologists to understand why you may lose sensation in your hand when sleeping and what you can do to tone down the tingling and numbness.</p>

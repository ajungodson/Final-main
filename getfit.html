    <h5>Best At-Home Workouts for You</h5>
      <p>
        For many of us, at-home workouts are the ultimate fitness dream: Gyms have their advantages, sure, but the idea of being able to focus solely on your body and exercise routine from the comfort of your own home — and not worry about what you're wearing, what you look like in the mirror next to other sweaty strangers or what equipment you'll use if the stuff you need is already taken — is the ideal workout scenario.

But where to begin? Finding the space and time for home workouts can be challenging. "While home workouts are convenient, there is also the possibility to blow them off because, well, you can always get to it 'later,'" says Kathryn Schmitz, PhD, president of the American College of Sports Medicine. "As such, plan for a home workout as if it's a spinning class and you need to arrive in time to get your favorite [bike]," she says, or block that tempting TV remote with your workout clothes.

Then there's the issue of finding the actual regimen that meets your personal fitness needs. "There are so many options for working out at home now, with more technology and equipment available to more people," Schmitz says. "There is value to a great cardio workout, strength training, HIIT training, balance, yoga and more. Think about what your goals are and design your workouts accordingly."

To help you do just that, we've compiled this start-to-finish guide to at-home workouts; from the home-gym equipment you'll need (or not need — body-weight exercises are perfect for home fitness) to every workout type and target you could ever imagine, we've got you covered.

So get ready to lose weight, boost your metabolism, build muscle or accomplish whatever personal fitness goal you've set for yourself right from your living room (or basement, or garage, or hallway, or... well, you get the picture!).

    <h5>Beginner-Friendly Workouts</h5>
      <p>
        If you're new to working out, it can be a bit overwhelming knowing where to start. In general, it's best to start with full-body, body-weight workouts that let you get used to the proper form of an exercise before adding weight, but it also depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Lucky for you, we've gathered all that knowledge into one helpful article for you so you can get started.

        What exactly are 5-inch shorts? These gym shorts have a 5-inch inseam, meaning the length of the fabric down the inner thigh is 5 inches long.

This length may be popular for its flattering look, but it's also super functional for working out. It keeps things breezy while making it so much easier to move forward, backward and side to side. That true whether you're into sprint intervals, strength training or yoga. (Nope, there will be no catching your knees on your shorts here.)

Browse our expert-approved top picks and add a pair of these much-beloved 5-inch shorts to your closet.

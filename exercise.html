    <p>Whether you go for short walks around your neighborhood, sprint through 10-mile-bike rides, or sweat it out at the gym, at some point you'll think, "This isn't as hard as it used to be!"

        That’s good progress. But it might be time to move on.
        
        You may have gotten so used to your routine that it’s simply too easy now. To get faster or stronger, or just beat boredom, it's time to change things up.
        
        It’s a fact: The best way to keep building muscle mass or burn calories is to make it a habit to switch up your workout -- especially when you notice that your current plan has become comfy. It keeps you on your toes. You’re ready to turn your walks into jogs, lift heavier weights, or swim faster than you might have thought you ever would.

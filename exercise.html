    <p> Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.

      It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, prevent aging, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.
      
      In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person. Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.Whether you go for short walks around your neighborhood, sprint through 10-mile-bike rides, or sweat it out at the gym, at some point you'll think, "This isn't as hard as it used to be!"

        That’s good progress. But it might be time to move on.
        
        You may have gotten so used to your routine that it’s simply too easy now. To get faster or stronger, or just beat boredom, it's time to change things up.
        
        It’s a fact: The best way to keep building muscle mass or burn calories is to make it a habit to switch up your workout -- especially when you notice that your current plan has become comfy. It keeps you on your toes. You’re ready to turn your walks into jogs, lift heavier weights, or swim faster than you might have thought you ever would.

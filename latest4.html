        <p>Love working out with kettlebells so much that it makes you want to break out into a dance? Well, that's essentially what a kettlebell flow is.

          Kettlebell flows allow you to move seamlessly from one exercise to the next without any pause in between â€” almost like a dance. For example, you can do a single-arm kettlebell row to a deadlift to a swing clean.
          
          They generally combine three or more exercises and work different muscle groups at once. By avoiding any pauses and breaks in between, the dynamic nature of kettlebells gets your heart rate soaring while improving your coordination, mobility and stability.
          
          And because you can combine unilateral (one-sided) with two-handed movements, you challenge your muscles in new ways. It also helps you hone in on your form, making sure each rep sets you up perfectly for the next move.
          
          Ready to get swinging? Here's a total-body beginner kettlebell flow to help you get started. You'll need a 10 to 16 kg (22 to 35.2 pounds) kettlebell. Do each exercise for 5 to 10 reps before moving on to the next move in the flow. Aim to do 2 to 3 rounds of the entire kettlebell flow for beginners.</p>

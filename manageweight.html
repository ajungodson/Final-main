    <h5>Portion Control Works — and How to Get It Right</h5>
      <p>
        If you're trying to lose weight, you've likely been told to "watch your portions!" by at least one well-meaning soul. This isn't bad advice, actually — as long as you know what the heck it means.

Here's a hint: Your diet-whisperer is likely talking about portion control, a practical approach to eating that puts the focus on food portion sizes (which are different from serving sizes — more on that later). The idea is that no foods are completely off-limits, but everything can and should be eaten in moderation.

Sounds pretty simple, right? But there are a few things you should know before you dive in. Here, we've put together everything you need to know about starting a portion-control diet, from the science-backed benefits to the tools and tricks dietitians swear by.

    <h5>What Is Portion Control, Anyway?</h5>
      <p>
        Portion control is a practical way of eating that can help you lose weight or simply eat healthier. Instead of counting calories or avoiding certain macronutrients altogether, this method puts the focus on learning what a healthy portion size of each food looks like — and sticking to it.

So, where to start? The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the go-to source when it comes to how much of each food group (vegetables, fruit, grains, dairy, protein and oils) you should be eating on the daily. While the USDA doesn't set rigid rules on portion sizes, it does offer general guidelines that you can adapt for your specific goals.

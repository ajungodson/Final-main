        <p> We all have that one friend who can allegedly hold a plank for 15 minutes. While none of us have ever stuck around long enough to actually ​see​ this astounding, 15-minute plank, it's pretty safe to assume that the form probably isn't perfect, especially toward the end of the time cap.

          Whether you're holding a crazy-long plank or practicing the move for 30 seconds at a time, the exercise becomes pointless if you're not doing it properly. Brush up on the correct plank form and absolutely avoid these five common mistakes.</p>

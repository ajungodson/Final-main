    <h5>First, Let's Talk Safety</h5>
      <p>
        Before you consider adding any vitamin or supplement to your dietary plan, speak to your health care professional.

        Why? Well, your body and needs are unique, and only a trained health care professional can tell you what's safe and what's not based on your health history, current conditions, prescription medications and other key factors. And if you're feeling hesitant to bring it up, keep in mind that your doc's goal is to help you be as healthy as possible, so no question about your wellness is too silly or small.
        
        Once you get the OK from your MD, here's some more food for thought: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not ensure the safety of dietary supplements before they go to market like it does for other food and drug products, so the quality and consistency of these products can vary.
        
        While some may be simply overrated and not deliver the results they promise, others could be harmful to your health. Luckily, there are a few easy ways to tell if a product is worth your investment.
